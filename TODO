Implement:
- enum validation
- blessing/accessor generation
- 64-bit mapping on 32-bit Perls
- constants for enums
- load from serialized descriptors
- extensions
- oneof fields
- parse from a scalar
- fix all XXX/TODO
- decode to blessed object that goes through C++ accessors
- use AvARRAY directly rather than going through av_fetch (maybe)
- serializing tied array/hashes

Test:
- inner type mapping
- inner optional messages
- groups
- import
